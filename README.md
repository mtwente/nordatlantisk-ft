# Voting Records of Greenlandic and Faroese MPs in Folketinget

This repository contains voting records of Greenlandic and Faroese Members of Parliament (MPs) in Folketing, the Parliament of Denmark. The data in nordatlantisk-ft is openly available to everyone and is intended to support reproducible research.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is based on the [Open Research Data Template](https://github.com/maehr/open-research-data-template) by [@maehr](https://github.com/maehr), follows the [Advanced Structure for Data Analysis](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-advanced.html) of _The Turing Way_ and is organized as follows:

- `analysis/`: scripts and notebooks used to analyze the data
- `assets/`: images, logos, etc. used in the README and other documentation
- `build/`: built files, PDF outputs
- `data/`: data files
- `docs/`: documentation for the data and the repository
- `src/`: source code for the data (e.g., scripts used to collect or process the data)
- `test/`: tests for the data and source code
- `report.md`: a report with basic insights into the data set

Additionally, there is a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5346749/nordatlantisk-ft) with a collection of scientific articles and news reports that are of relevance for studying the Northatlantic MPs' work in Folketinget.

## Data Description

This repository contains voting records of Greenlandic and Faroese MPs. Voting records are available online starting October 2004.

For all MPs that were elected in either Greenland or the Faroe Islands since 2004, voting records were retrieved from [Folketingets √•bne data service (ODA)](https://www.ft.dk/dokumenter/aabne_data). Because Folketinget seems to have changed their way of record keeping since 2004, the retrieved data had to be processed to consolidate different variables (e.g. extracting ballot results stored as one text string into four numeric variables).

In this repository, the raw data is available as `csv` files, and processed data is available as `rds` and `csv` files including metadata. Also included is the workflow to replicate and update the data set using R.

Descriptions of all variables are provided in the [codebook](./docs/codebook.md). Take a first glance at the dataset [in report.md](report.md).

### Installation

Use the [renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to install all dependencies and set up a reproducible environment within the R project. To see which packages are loaded with renv for the workflow before installing them to the project library, run `renv::dependencies()`.

```r
renv::restore()
```

If you are running a recent Mac OS, you will have to [install a Fortran compiler manually](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) for compiling the packages before running `renv::restore()`.

### Build

This project uses the [targets package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) for managing the workflow of building and updating the data set.

```r
targets::tar_make()
```

Running `tar_make()` will execute the workflow as defined in [`_targets.R`](./_targets.R), skipping files ('targets') that have not changed since the last build process.

The targets pipeline is set to check for new voting records **every twelve weeks only**. To force running the scripts with the most recent data available, remove the `cue` arguments from the targets `ballot_info` and `raw_voting_records` in `_targets.R`.

You can use the scripts to assemble data sets with voting records of other members of Folketinget as well. To download voting records for other MPs, look up their ODA IDs at [oda.ft.dk](https://oda.ft.dk), add the IDs to the column `MP_names$MP_id` in the file available at [`./data/processed/csv/MP_names.csv`](./data/processed/csv/MP_names.csv) and then run `targets::tar_make()`.

## Use

This data is openly available to everyone and can be used for any research or educational purpose. If you use this data in your research, please cite as specified in [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff).

## Roadmap

- implement function to automatically match MP names with IDs from [oda.ft.dk](https://oda.ft.dk), perhaps using [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P10207)
- implement [gittargets](https://github.com/ropensci/gittargets)
- implement [frictionless-r](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/frictionless-r)
- implement tests
- in addition to the [Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5346749/nordatlantisk-ft), provide bibliography for scientific literature on Northatlantic MPs as BibTeX file.
- add DOI to README and CITATION.cff
